* The intercept, vehcicle length and ground clearance proved to provide a non-random effect on our mpg values in the data set, as they had p-values < 0.05.
* The slope of the model would not be equal to zero, as the analysis shows that there were indpendent variables that had a significant effect on the dependent variable.
* The R-squared value for this model was 0.7149. This means the mmodel would correctly predict the mpg of MechaCar 71.49% of the time, which would be considered as effective.
